**Our adventure game follows a Nazi Major General Mauser as he chooses his path and discovers his ethical framework (or dies trying). There are several different endings based on Mauser’s choices:**

### Bad Ending - The Common Good Approach
The belief that things were all for a “greater good” was instrumental in Hitler’s machine. In this ending, you fail to evade the corruption Hitler’s propaganda brought to so many minds, and you fall in line happily, as did so many other Germans. Hitler’s ‘common good’ becomes yours with this tragic ending.

### Sad Ending - Self-Preservation
In this ending, you take the bad route of self-preservation. There are two different endings for this ideal of keeping yourself safe: one where you can escape and one where you follow orders out of fear. The sad ending represents the latter, and whether it be due to Hitler or Himmler’s intimidation or your surprise by how easily Germany was winning, you fall in line just the same.

### Death Ending - No ethical framework
You just die. 

### Neutral Ending - Self-Preservation.
You have escaped and are in hiding. You are alive, but at what cost? You lie awake each night thinking of the war and its horrors and in fear that you will be discovered and prosecuted.

### Good Ending - The Virtue Approach
You stayed true to your virtues in the end, and despite the pain you helped inflict, you were instrumental in ending the war sooner. By sticking to what you knew was right, you saved millions.
